Minimum Spanning Trees
- A MST is a subgraph of G, s.t from the starting vertex to the end vertex the path has the 
  least cost.
- A tree can not have a cycle while a graph can have cycles.

Kruskal's Algorithm

- Sort all the edges according to their weights
- add the lowest weighted edge to the MST until edge_largestWeight
- Avoid cycles by using disjoint sets

Time Complexity:
  - Sorting is most expensive, total complexity of disjoint-set operations: O(ElogV)
  - O(ElogV) is the overall complexity of the alg.
  

Why use Disjoint sets?

- Since Disjoint sets are those sets that have an empty set at their 
  intersection, using them allows us to find elements that have
  nothing in common.
- Why not use a DFS instead?
  b/c DFS has a time complexity of O(V+E)
